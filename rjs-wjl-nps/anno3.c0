//test return 0

// I don't see any good explanaition for why this shouldn't be allowed,
// but as of 1/14/2011 this fails because the declaration int i = 0 is
// implicitly in a local scope generated by the annotation. -rjs

// Fixed to return 0 as it should, 1/16/2011 -fp

int main() {
  //@assert true;
  int i = 0;
  return i;
